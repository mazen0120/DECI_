    <h1>Title: Twitter Data Analysis and Visualization</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Python script performs a comprehensive analysis of Twitter data related to dog ratings. It leverages various Python libraries, including pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and sqlite3, to handle, clean, analyze, and visualize the data.</p>
    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>The script reads data from multiple sources, including JSON and CSV files. It also downloads a TSV file using the requests library.</p>
    <h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
    <p>The script performs several data cleaning tasks, including removing retweets and replies, tweets without images, and duplicates. It also corrects dog names, combines dog stages into one column, and handles missing values. The timestamp is converted to datetime for easier manipulation.</p>
    <h2>Data Wrangling</h2>
    <p>The script merges multiple datasets into a master DataFrame. It also creates a new column for the dog rating by dividing the rating numerator by the rating denominator. Unnecessary columns are dropped to tidy up the data.</p>
    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>The cleaned data is stored in a CSV file and a SQLite database for future use. This allows for efficient retrieval and manipulation of the data for subsequent analysis.</p>
    <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
    <p>The script performs several analyses on the cleaned data. It examines the distribution of dog ratings, identifies the most common dog names, and investigates the relationship between retweets and favorites.</p>
    <h2>Data Visualization</h2>
    <p>The script generates several plots to visualize the results of the analysis. These include a histogram of dog ratings, a bar chart of the most common dog names, and a scatter plot showing the relationship between retweets and favorites.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This script provides a comprehensive analysis of Twitter data related to dog ratings. It demonstrates the power of Python libraries in handling, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing large datasets. The insights derived from this analysis could be useful for understanding trends in dog ratings on Twitter.</p>
